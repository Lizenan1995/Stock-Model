## Data Prepare
You should put this .py file under GPSJ folder. It generates csv file by stock, as well as by feature.

#### Work to Be Completed
1. Data missing 
For some feature, some stock do not even have one piece of data. 
e.g. For stock 000001.SZ, there is no record for its ROIC data.

2. Factor Analysis
Colinearity etc.

3. Other important data, which should be calculated in the future (man man lai ba, md 70 ge yin zi)
